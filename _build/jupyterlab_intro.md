 1 - Introduction to JupyterLab


## What is Jupyterlab?

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) is the next-generation web-based user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). It is made of modular building blocks:

- File explorer
- Text editor
- Diagram generator
- jupyter notebooks supporting more than 50 different Jupyter kernels
- Terminals
- Outputs

with an easy integration with Jupyterlab extension such as [jupyterlab-latex](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-latex) for live-editing of LaTeX documents, [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) and [jupyterlab-nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html) for git integration, [jupyterlab-drawio](https://github.com/QuantStack/jupyterlab-drawio) for creating diagrams and [jupyterlab-zenodo](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-zenodo/) to easily publish research work and get proper [DOI](https://www.doi.org/).

See [JupyterLab slides](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/blob/master/slides/jupyterlab-slides.pdf) from [JupyterLab Github demo repository](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo) for more information about JupyterLab. 




## Get familiar with Jupyterlab


Make sure you have JupyterLab installed and start it:

![JupyterLab interface](images/jupyterlab.png)

You can also run the [JupyterLab demo](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo) with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/Lorenz.ipynb).



## JupyterLab extensions

The JupyterLab Graphical User Interface varies depending on the available kernels (`python`, `R`, `julia`, etc.) but also on the [JupyterLab extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html) you have installed.
And this is where JupyterLab differs from the "classical" Jupyter Notebooks.

> ## JupyterLab extension Manager
>
> Enable **Extension Manager**
> <img src="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/extension_manager_enable_manager.png" />
> **Figure:** The default view has three components: a search bar, an "Installed" section, and a "Discover" section.
>
{: .task}

Once enabled, you can see the list of extensions installed and update/uninstall/disable them. With **SEARCH**, you can find and install available extensions.

> ## Warning
> JupyterLab extensions make JupyterLab highly flexible and can really offer a fully customized user environment but 
> the following recommendations are **important**:
> - only install extensions you can trust (as it allows to execute arbitrary code on the server, kernel, and in the clientâ€™s browser)
> - some extensions may not be compatible with some versions of JupyterLab and may break it (as extensions are developed independently of JupyterLab).
>
{: .callout}

> ## Exercise
> Install a few extensions such as:
> - [jupyterlab-latex](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-latex) for live-editing of LaTeX documents, 
> - [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) and [jupyterlab-nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html) for git integration, 
> - [jupyterlab-zenodo](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-zenodo/) to easily publish research work and get proper [DOI](https://www.doi.org/).
>
> > ## Solution
> > - Click on **DISCOVER** or type a word in **SEARCH** to find the corresponding extension 
> > - then click on **Install** to install and enable it. During the process, you may get a message such as *A build is needed to include the latest changes*: click on **Rebuild** to continue. At the end of the process, you will be asked to **Reload** the page which is the last step of the installation process.

Finally, as you probably already guessed, JupyterLab extensions can be developed independently of JupyterLab itself and anyone can create and distribute new extensions. You can find a step by step tutorial on [how to create a new extension](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/extension_tutorial.html). However, before starting any new development, make sure you find out whether this extension already exist or not.
