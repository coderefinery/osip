One important aspect to embrace Open Science is to base your scientific process on cooperative work and use many different ways for disseminating the results of your research to be as inclusive as possible.  
Achieving openness requires an open approach at all stages of the research process and requires you to identify the key actors i.e. your target audience. As this may evolve, it is important to choose tools that can facilitate the access to your research and not only the final results as you would when publishing in a "traditional" scientific journal.  


One crucial milestone is to be able to reproduce your research. However, it would be highly beneficial to document the successive steps and methods that lead to the published conclusions. Not only would this allow to fully understand the approach followed but it should foster new ideas and/or raise questions that should lead to further developments, beyond your original work. That is what Science is about, isn't it?

In addition to showing off successful research, maybe would it also be useful to comment on dead ends and/or failures so that others understand where you are getting from.

This is why it is important to keep track of everything, as one would do for instance in a laboratory notebook, and to share it through different channels (blog, twitter, conferences, workshops, etc.).


Ideally, this process should not require much more time and/or efforts. 

In this workshop, we aim at giving you a few tips towards Open Science and explore tools to convert your well documented notebook into various formats suited for disseminating your research through different media. 

With practice, the time it takes to document reproducible research decreases and the **benefit for your own research** increases.
