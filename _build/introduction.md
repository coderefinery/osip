One important aspect to embrace Open Science is to base your scientific process on cooperative work and use many different ways for diffusing the results of your research to be as inclusive as possible.  
Achieving openness requires an open approach at all stages of the research process and requires you to identify the key actors i.e. your target audience. As this may evolve, it is important to choose tools that can facilitate the diffusion of your research results.  

Ideally, writing a reproducible paper should not take more time than writing papers which are not reproducible. In this workshop, we aim at giving you a few tips so it can becoe a reality. With practice, the time it takes to write reproducible papers decreases.
