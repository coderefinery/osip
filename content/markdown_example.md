## Lists

### Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - sub-list-1
    - sub-list-2

### Ordered

1. this is the first item
2. this is the second item
3. this is the third item


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as 1

### Start numbering with offset:

12. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` python
print("hello")
```

## Tables

### Centred columns

| col-1 | col-2 |
| ------ |----------- |
| row-1   | text for row-1 |
| row-2 | text for row-2|
| row-3    | text for row-3 |

### Right aligned columns
| col-1 | col-2 |
| ------:| -----------:|
| row-1   | text for row-1 |
| row-2 | text for row-2|
| row-3    | text for row-3 |

The same can be done for aligning columns on the left 
(character `:` is then placed on the left such as `|:---|`).
